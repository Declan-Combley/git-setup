# What this repository is for
This script makes setting up git using ssh keys a bit more painless.


# Prerequisites
You must have xclip installed aswell as git and root privileges.


# How does it work?
Its pretty cluncky but it copies your ssh key to the clipboard ready to be pasted in to the terminal.
